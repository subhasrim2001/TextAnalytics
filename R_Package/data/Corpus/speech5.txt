Today gentlemen, I am honored to coach you

More honored to be leading you onto the field of battle

But theres another honor to be bestowed upon you

And that is in the answer that comes with that question:

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Thats right, and you need to remember that all through this game

I will conquer what has not been conquered

Defeat will not be in my creed

I will believe what others have doubted

I will always endeavor to pull esteem, honor, and respect out of my team

I have trained my mind and my body will follow

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

I will acknowledge the fact that my opponent does not expect me to win

But I will never surrender

Weakness will not be in my heart

I will look to my comrades and to those who are a part of me in this world and those who have trained me

And I will draw strength from them

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

I will gladly go out into the field of battle

And I will move in everything I can do

And I will reach my field of battle by any means at my disposal

And when I get there, I will arrive violently

I will rip the heart from my enemy, and leave it bleeding on the ground

Because he cannot stop me

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

To my side I have comrades, comrades that have been with me through thick and thin

Who have sacrificed their blood, sweat and tears

Never will I let them fall, never will I let them down, and I will never leave an enemy behind

Because our opponent does not know my heart

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

No one will deny me, no one will define me

And no one will tell me who and what I am and can be

Belief will change my world

It has moved continents, it has moved countries, it has put men on the moon

And it will carry me through this battle

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Defeat, retreat: those are not in my words

I dont understand those definitions

I dont understand when things go wrong

I dont understand mistakes

But I do understand this:

I understand victory,

And I understand never surrendering

No matter how bad things go my heart and my mind will carry my body through limits and weakness

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Today will be that day

Not tomorrow, not next week, but right now, right here

In your house and in your homes

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

History will remember me

I will not let worrying affect my cause

I will define myself

I will write my own pages

And no one will tell me what I cannot be

I will never give up

Not until Ive given everything I got

Because who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!

Who am I? I AM A CHAMPION!
